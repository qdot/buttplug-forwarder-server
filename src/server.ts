////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Server Explanation
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Welcome to the server portion of the Simple Teledildonics app.
//
// This server allows 1 user to share their hardware, while another user can
// connect and control it. Multiple connections are not allowed on either end,
// only one sharer and one controller at any time. The sharer must connect
// before the controller.
//
// The server hosts 3 endpoints:
//
// - /
//   - This is a dual protocol endpoint. Via HTTP, this shows the index page.
//     Via websocket, it allows people to connect to control shared hardware.
// - /forwarder
//   - This is a websocket endpoint. It allows a user to share their hardware.
// - /status
//   - This is a websocket endpoint, used by the forwader user to get status
//     about remote connections.
//
// The expected execution flow is as follows:
//
// - A user connects to the "local" (sharer) side and chooses toys to share.
// - Another user then connects to the "Remote" (controller) side to control
//   the shared toys.
// - If the "local" user disconnects, the "remote" will be disconnected.
// - Similarly, if no "local" is connected, no "remote" can connect.
//
// Security is in the form of passwords which are set in the .env file, which
// Glitch assigns to process.env. There is a separate password for local users
// and remote users, so that only those that know the password can use the
// application. The idea is that each person who wants to use the application
// should set up their own version of it, freeing us from having to deal with
// things like user databases. If the passwords are not set, the server will not
// run and will instead warn the user to set the passwords.
//
// The server is written in Typescript because it's just what I'm used to. It's
// probably doable in JS, but I kinda ran out of energy and I work much faster
// in Typescript. This doesn't use much in the way to Typescript features
// though, so hopefully it'll be fairly understandable.

// version of it, then our endpoints can fire events through it to notify each
